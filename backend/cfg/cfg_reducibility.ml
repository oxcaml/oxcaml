(** A way to check whether a CFG is reducible is to:
  1. compute the dominators;
  2. identify the back edges (i.e. edges such that the destination dominates
     the source);
  3. create a copy of the CFG without the back edges;
  4. if that copy has a cycle, then the original CFG is irreducible,
     otherwise it is reducible.

  Since a `Cfg_with_infos.t` value already has the dominator information, we
  simply implement cycle detection with a tweaked implementation which ignores
  back edges.
  
  The current/naive implementation of cycle detection is a variant of Kahn's
  algorithm:
  - we start with a set of blocks/labels to sort equal to the set of all blocks;
  - we compute a table giving for each block the set of its predecessors
    (ignoring back edges);
  - we look for cycles by:
    . computing the set of blocks with no predecessors;
    . remove these blocks from the table of predecessors;
    . until all blocks have been sorted (in which case there is no cycle), or
      we have no blocks with no predecessors (in which case there is a cycle). *)
