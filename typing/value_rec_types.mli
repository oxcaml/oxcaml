  (** The expression evaluates to a function or block of a
      statically known size.
      It will be pre-allocated and back-patched later.
      The expression can refer to recursive variables as long as it
      does not inspect them during its evaluation. *)
| Constant
  (** The expression evaluates to a value that does not contain any
      occurrence of a recursive variable.
      Combined with the invariant that recursive variables must never be
      examined during the definitions, this special case allow using the
      same rules as Static bindings (i.e. allow guarded occurrences of
      recursive variables in the expression) for values that cannot be
      back-patched (unit, integers, empty arrays, ...). *)
| Not_recursive
  (** Non recursive bindings. Arbitrary expressions, that are not allowed to
      refer to any recursive variable. *)
| Class
  (** Bindings generated by the compilation of objects and classes.
      These bindings are generated in Lambda form directly and never go through
      [Rec_check], so to avoid re-implementing the classification pass on Lambda
      we simply identify this special case with a dedicated constructor. *)
