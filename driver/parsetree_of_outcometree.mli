(** Conversion of the outcome tree of a type to a parse tree, for the
    generated code of [Laws_gen]: the compiler has no conversion from
    [Types] to [Parsetree], and the outcome tree is where paths are
    shortened. *)

(** Fails with [Misc.fatal_error] on the other outcome trees: those of
    declarations ([Otyp_record], [Otyp_sum], ...), quotes and splices,
    modalities, and kind variables. *)
