(* CR jrickard: This test highlights a bug in eval: The cmx that gets built
   from this claims it depends on [Stdlib] because it depends on [Stdlib.Buffer]
   which is correct for the cmi lookup but breaks for cmx lookup because
   [Stdlib] doesn't depend on the implementation of [Stdlib__Buffer]. Maybe I
   need to split the quotation depends into intf and impls? (and somehow do a
   lookup that resolves to Stdlib__Buffer). *)
