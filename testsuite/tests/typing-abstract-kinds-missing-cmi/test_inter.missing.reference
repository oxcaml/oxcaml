2 | type ('a : B.k3) s = 'a t
                         ^^
Error: This type "('a : B.k3)" should be an instance of type "('b : B.k1)"
       The kind of 'a is A2.k3
         because of the annotation on 'a in the declaration of the type s.
       But the kind of 'a must overlap with A1.k1 mod portable
         because of the definition of t at file "c_inter.ml", line 1, characters 0-18.
       No .cmi file found containing A1.k1.
       No .cmi file found containing A2.k3.
       Hint: Adding "a1" to your dependencies might help.
       Hint: Adding "a2" to your dependencies might help.
