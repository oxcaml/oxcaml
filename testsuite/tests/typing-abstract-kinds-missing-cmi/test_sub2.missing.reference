Error: The kind of type "t" is A1.k1 mod portable
         because of the definition of t at file "c_sub2.ml", line 1, characters 0-13.
       But the kind of type "t" must be a subkind of A1.k2
         because of the definition of s at file "c_sub2.ml", line 3, characters 0-17.
       No .cmi file found containing A1.k1.
       No .cmi file found containing A1.k2.
       Hint: Adding "a1" to your dependencies might help.
