(* This test need to *not* be in classic mode to run,
   since it requires match-in-match/continuation specialization *)
[@@@ocaml.flambda_o3]

(* This code triggers continuation specialization in a situation
   where the first downwards pass on the specialized continuation
   can create some lifted constants (specifically a set of closures
   in this case), constants which must be "forgotten" since flambda
   ignores that first pass when specializing a continuation.
