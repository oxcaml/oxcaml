(* [exn] currently crosses portability and contention.

   To make it safe, exception constructors under a portable lock:
   - Require their fields cross contention and be at portable during creation
   - Require their fields cross portability and mark as contended during pattern-matching

   This can be modeled as each exception constructor being contained in
   the original capsule it was defined in. Creating/destroying instances
   of that constructor moves its arguments across capsule boundaries.
