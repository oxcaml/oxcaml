(* TODO (ZJE): ALSO WORTH TESTING:
    - make sure that comments work; specifically, that doc comments are attached to the

(* in addition to the mod modes on arrow types, there are some more odd consequences
   of this choice of syntax, which are noted here for examination:

  mod modalities interaction with with-bounds: parses as mod jkind_annotation

  type 'a t : immutable_data with 'a mod contended
  type 'a t : immutable_data with 'a -> 'a mod contended

  kind_of_ similarly has weird precedence-related cases.

  type 'a t : kind_of_ 'a mod global
  (* these two cases parse identically *)
  type 'a t : kind_of_ 'a -> 'a mod global
  type 'a t : kind_of_ ('a -> 'a) mod global
