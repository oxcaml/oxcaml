(** Observe the variables bound in a Flambda 2 [unit] body, and in [all_code]
    when given, recording them for the [Variable_availability] diagnostic at
    [checkpoint] (gated on [Clflags.dump_variable_availability]).

    [all_code] holds the function bodies that simplification lifts out of the
    unit into a side table. It is omitted only for the raw normal-mode unit,
    whose code is still inline. *)
